# Jaql
Some repo that I'm pretending is Yesql but isn't done yet

This is not hosted on maven central I just use https://jitpack.io/ for hosting.
    
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
    
    dependencies {
        compile 'com.github.Zergleb:Jaql:0.0.2' // You can see the releases in the releases tab.
    }
